It then prioritizes these vulnerabilities, building a live threat map of the organization's infrastructure, using asset context analysis. Lastly, a shim layer is deployed to protect software from identified vulnerabilities by limiting access to its exploitable code in real-time.

Focusing on finite “good” actions allows PARANOID to be completely agnostic to threats and attack vectors. PARANOID works seamlessly with antivirus and next-generation antivirus solutions to provide the last line of defense from modern state-level attacks.","lifespan_years":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nyotron","acquisition_amount_m":"http://www.nyotron.com","acquirer_name":"https://www.twitter.com/nyotron","logo":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nyotron","":""},{"company_name":"IntSights","category":"Threat Intelligence","total_funding_until_exited_m":71.3,"founded":"2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","exit_date":"IntSights is an external threat intelligence and protection platform built to neutralize threats outside the wire.","lifespan_years":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intsights","acquisition_amount_m":"https://intsights.com/","acquirer_name":"https://www.twitter.com/intsights","logo":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/intsights","":"https://www.ylventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Intsights-Logo.png"},{"company_name":"empow","category":"Security Operations","total_funding_until_exited_m":19,"founded":"2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","exit_date":"Empow is a cyber-security startup that introduces a new approach to the security arena.","lifespan_years":"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/empow-cyber-security","acquisition_amount_m":"http://www.empownetworks.com/","acquirer_name":"https://twitter.com/empowcyber","logo":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/empow","":"https://www.ylventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Empow-Logo.png"},{"company_name":"Ayehu Software Technologies","category":"Security Operations","total_funding_until_exited_m":4.1,"founded":"2015-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","exit_date":"Ayehu is the IT Automation and Orchestration platform built for the Digital Era.
