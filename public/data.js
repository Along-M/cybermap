        "description": "Finding Your Security Blind Spots CyCognito was founded by veterans of national intelligence agencies who understand how attackers exploit blind spots, and who recognized the need for a radical new approach to threat assessment. Legacy security testing approaches, like vulnerability scanners and pen testing services, help security teams find and fix blind spots within on-premises and directly managed infrastructure. But, they are no match for the rapidly expanding attack surface that results from modern, highly distributed IT architectures that span SaaS, IaaS, Shadow IT, and partner services. Nor are legacy solutions capable of discovering the majority of sophisticated attack vectors that modern attackers use. Our mission is to build the next-generation security risk assessment product category: solutions that autonomously discover, enumerate and prioritize each organization’s security risks based upon a global analysis of all external attack surfaces, and attack vectors that a real attacker would likely exploit. We believe that a cloud-based security solution that collects global attack surface data should become the foundational platform upon which all other external security testing services are performed, including Vulnerability Assessments, Penetration Tests, Red Team Tests, Partner Security Audits, Compliance Tests, and Bug Bounty Programs. This is the CyCAST Platform - the CyCognito Continuous Attack Surface Testing Platform."

It then prioritizes these vulnerabilities, building a live threat map of the organization's infrastructure, using asset context analysis.Lastly, a shim layer is deployed to protect software from identified vulnerabilities by limiting access to its exploitable code in real - time.Topia is live and already protecting dozens of organizations worldwide.Vicarius' Topia clients enjoy a complete and automatic solution for the secure management of any software services in their network - shattering the common paradigm of software being treated as \"safe\" until a vulnerability is exposed. This new mind shift allows organizations to protect any software without involving the vendor or even their own IT teams. Vicarius was founded in 2016 by three entrepreneurs from the information- security industry and operates out of Jerusalem's Machane Yehuda Market."

Much like the training  of a fighter pilot, Cyberbit Range puts cybersecurity team members into a hyper-realistic training environment using a virtual network that can mimic the actual network of a specific company or organization (military, government, or university). Using our attack generator, an instructor can insert various attack types (including IT and OT attacks) of differing difficulty levels (for individuals or teams) that trainees (Red or Blue teams) must respond to using commercial grade tools they would use on their everyday jobs (Checkpoint EDR, McAfee, IBM QRadar, Arcsight, etc.). To increase the difficulty, Cyberbit Range also has a benign traffic generator (HTTP, email, etc.) so that trainees will learn to identify the difference between benign and malicious traffic. Cyberbit Range is available as an on-premise or cloud solution, depending on the needs of the client. Clients can also customize networks and attacks to fit their specific stack and network to test playbooks, network setups, and train teams to their specific needs and requirements.",
