        "description": "Finding Your Security Blind Spots CyCognito was founded by veterans of national intelligence agencies who understand how attackers exploit blind spots, and who recognized the need for a radical new approach to threat assessment. Legacy security testing approaches, like vulnerability scanners and pen testing services, help security teams find and fix blind spots within on-premises and directly managed infrastructure. But, they are no match for the rapidly expanding attack surface that results from modern, highly distributed IT architectures that span SaaS, IaaS, Shadow IT, and partner services. Nor are legacy solutions capable of discovering the majority of sophisticated attack vectors that modern attackers use. Our mission is to build the next-generation security risk assessment product category: solutions that autonomously discover, enumerate and prioritize each organization’s security risks based upon a global analysis of all external attack surfaces, and attack vectors that a real attacker would likely exploit. We believe that a cloud-based security solution that collects global attack surface data should become the foundational platform upon which all other external security testing services are performed, including Vulnerability Assessments, Penetration Tests, Red Team Tests, Partner Security Audits, Compliance Tests, and Bug Bounty Programs. This is the CyCAST Platform - the CyCognito Continuous Attack Surface Testing Platform."

The founders discovered that all existing anti-fraud solutions were built on outdated technologies and therefore not good enough to deal with sophisticated cyber criminals. Existing rule-based systems as well as classical machine learning solutions are expensive and can't adapt to new fraud patterns in real-time, hence inaccurate."

It then prioritizes these vulnerabilities, building a live threat map of the organization's infrastructure, using asset context analysis.Lastly, a shim layer is deployed to protect software from identified vulnerabilities by limiting access to its exploitable code in real - time.Topia is live and already protecting dozens of organizations worldwide.Vicarius' Topia clients enjoy a complete and automatic solution for the secure management of any software services in their network - shattering the common paradigm of software being treated as \"safe\" until a vulnerability is exposed. This new mind shift allows organizations to protect any software without involving the vendor or even their own IT teams.
